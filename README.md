# RAG-Chatbot-with-Google-Docs-Integration
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain, Flask, and Google Docs API. It allows users to load their Google Docs into a knowledge base and ask intelligent, context-aware questions — all powered by OpenAI’s large language models.
