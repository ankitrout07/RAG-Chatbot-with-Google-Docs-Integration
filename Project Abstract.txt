📌 Problem Statement (Explained)

You need to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot that integrates with Google Docs.

The flow is:

1. User signs in with Google account (OAuth 2.0).
2. The chatbot fetches all Google Docs associated with that account.
3. User selects which docs to add to the chatbot’s knowledge base.
4. When the user asks a question in natural language:

   * The chatbot searches within the selected docs (retrieval).
   * Generates an answer (generation).
5. If the answer is not found in the docs, the bot:

   * Explicitly says: “Not found in your docs”
   * Still gives a general answer using its own knowledge.


📌 Mandatory Requirements (Simplified)

1. Google OAuth 2.0 → Login system.
2. Backend in Python → All logic must be written in Python (e.g., FastAPI/Flask/Django).
3. Fetch & display Google Docs → Show user’s document list.
4. Select documents to add → User decides which docs the chatbot uses.
5. RAG pipeline → Retrieve info from selected docs + generate meaningful response.
6. Fallback behavior → If docs don’t help, fallback to general chatbot knowledge.
7. Simple chatbot interface → Web-based UI for chatting.

📌 What You Need to Learn (Prerequisites)

To build this project, you’ll need to cover these core skills/tools:

1. APIs & Authentication

* Learn Google OAuth 2.0 (logging in with Google).
* Work with Google Drive API and Google Docs API (fetch, read documents).
* Handling API tokens/refresh tokens.

2. Python Backend Development

* Flask or FastAPI (preferred) → for API routes and chatbot backend.
* Basics of handling requests/responses (REST APIs).

3. Data Retrieval + Processing

* Learn vector databases (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS) to store document embeddings.
* Learn how to use embeddings (OpenAI embeddings, Hugging Face sentence transformers).
* LangChain or LlamaIndex → frameworks that simplify building RAG pipelines.

4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* How embeddings work for semantic search.
* How RAG retrieves chunks from documents.
* Basics of transformer models for text generation.

5. Frontend (Chat Interface)

* Web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* Or use a frontend framework like React (optional, but nice).
* Connecting frontend with backend via API calls.

6. General Software Development Skills

* Git/GitHub for version control.
* JSON handling (since APIs return JSON).
* Error handling, debugging.


📌 Recommended Learning Path

1. Learn Flask/FastAPI basics.
2. Learn OAuth 2.0 with Google (login, fetching docs).
3. Learn how to use Google Drive + Docs API in Python.
4. Learn embeddings + vector databases (FAISS/Pinecone).
5. Learn LangChain for RAG chatbot building.
6. Build a simple chatbot UI (start with Flask + HTML/JS, later upgrade).
